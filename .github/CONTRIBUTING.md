# Contributing

- PropsExpedition adheres to the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://js.foundation/community/code-of-conduct).
- Goals are tracked in [milestones](https://github.com/jdolle/props-expedition/milestones), but these priorities can be adjusted if necessary.
- If your issue falls outside the scope of the next milestone, it likely won't be addressed until after the next release. However, if you submit a pull request, it is likely we will address it quicker.

# Coding conventions

- Keep in mind that our goals (_reusability_ and _simplicity_) when contributing. Any "_magic_" should be avoided.
- Test coverage must remain at 100%. No pull request will be accepted if tests do not pass.
- Linting must pass. If you have an argument for/against a linting rule, this should be part of a separate pull request.
- PropsExpedition uses SemVer versioning. Any bug fixes are patch, new features are minor, and non-backwards compatible features are major. If you have a question, don't hesitate to post your pull request then ask what the version should be.
